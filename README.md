# BGS_Compass
## Usage
A simple compass/map item mod to use in your RedM VORP server.

Associates the usage of the compass/map (configurable on and off for each) with an item.

If the player has the compass item, they can see their compass (compass visibility and type is configurable).<br>
The player can also select their own compass type in the game menu but this will still require the compass item (configurable on/off).

If the player has the map item, they can use the map.

Item names are configurable, as well as the time to check for map/compass inventory updates.

Big thanks to Outsider for his help on optimizing this!
